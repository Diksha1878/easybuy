        <p>We have a 7 day return policy, which means you have 7 days after receiving your item to request a return.
            </br> </br>
            To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging.
            </br> </br>
            To start a return, you can contact us at Sales@easy-buy.in. If your return is accepted, we’ll send you a return shipping label, as well as instructions on how and where to send your package. Items sent back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted.
            <strong class="fw-bold">Easy-buy does not encourage indiscriminate buying and returning</strong>. It not only financially hurts the seller, the staff's efforts but also harms the environment, in so much that many litres of fuel and excess CO2 is released just to send and pickup an item, which could have been avoided. So please make an informed decision before buying.
