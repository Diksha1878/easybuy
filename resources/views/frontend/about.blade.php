                                <p>Easy-buy is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Easy-buy strives to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, Earth’s best employer, and Earth’s safest place to work. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 text-dark" style="margin-bottom:3px">Leadership Principles</p>
                                <p>We hold ourselves and each other accountable for demonstrating the Leadership Principles through our actions every day. Our Leadership Principles describe how Easy-buy does business, how leaders lead, and how we keep the customer at the center of our decisions. Our unique Easy-buy culture, described by our Leadership Principles, helps us relentlessly pursue our mission of being Earth’s most customer-centric company, best employer, and safest place to work.</p>

                    <h3 class="h5">Customer Obsession</h3>
                    <p>Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="mt-4">
                    <h3 class="h5">Ownership</h3>
                    <p>Leaders are owners. They think long term and do not sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="mt-4">
                    <h3 class="h5">Think Big</h3>
                    <p>Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="mt-4">
                    <h3 class="h5">Earn Trust</h3>
                    <p>Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="mt-4">
                    <h3 class="h5">Dive Deep</h3>
                    <p>Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are sceptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="mt-4">
                    <h3 class="h5">Delivery and Logistics</h3>
                    <p>Our Operations and award-winning Customer Service teams are at the heart of Amazon’s mission to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. Together, we create, we build and we take ownership for what we do—whether we are developing new technology in-house, launching an Amazon fulfilment centre or delighting our customers by delivering packages directly to them. We are constantly creating the ideas, services and products that make life easier for millions of customers.</p>

                <div class="mt-4">
                    <h3 class="h5">Leave a Mark</h3>
                    <p>We're known more by the impact we create than the titles we hold. Impact that is brought by working together on audacious challenges at scale with an aim to revolutionize for the Indian customer. We believe great ideas can emerge from anywhere and must be backed. Our people - backed by our culture of end-to-end ownership - have revolutionized India's e-commerce sector - several times over!</p>

                    <h3 class="h5">Experiment Learn Grow</h3>
                    <p>Our journey of building India's biggest unicorn start-up has been full of successes, but also failures and learning from them. That's why there's calculated risk-taking, a high willingness to learn and improvise, and a growth orientation built into everything we do. Whether it be opening a new warehouse, or making our mobile app a bit more consumer friendly, we’re always experimenting, learning and growing!.</p>
